# Search Algorithm Visualization

## Work in progress 

This programm will visualize different sorting algorithms and how they work. 
The sorting will be presented within a tkinter canvas. Different sort algorithms are going to be implemented.
Program consists out of several classes to perform all the tasks required. The separate folder contain the files as follows:

### GraphicalUserInterface
